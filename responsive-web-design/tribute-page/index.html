          <li id="tribute-info">Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, was born on December 10, 1815, in London, England. She was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Byron. Her upbringing was guided by her mother's insistence on a rigorous education in mathematics and science.</li>
          <li id="tribute-info">Lovelace showed an early aptitude for mathematics, influenced by her mother's emphasis on education in science and mathematics. She worked with mathematicians and scientists of her time, including Augustus De Morgan.</li>
          <li id="tribute-info">Ada Lovelace is often recognized as the world's first computer programmer. In the mid-19th century, she wrote the first algorithm intended for implementation on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, a design for a mechanical general-purpose computer.</li>
          <li id="tribute-info">Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine not only contained the algorithm but also explored the possibilities of the machine, discussing concepts that can be likened to computer programming, such as loops and conditionals</li>
          <li id="tribute-info">Ada Lovelace's contributions to computing were recognized many years after her death. The programming language "Ada" was named in her honor, and her work is celebrated annually on Ada Lovelace Day, an event highlighting the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</li>
