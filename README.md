# freeCodeCamp Practice

Welcome Nappers! This place is just a tiny spot I made to drop all my small projects and experiments over time as I explore freeCodeCamp's curriculum. For my outputs, I'll try to limit what I'll implement based on what's presented in the course (and make small tweaks later on if I remember). That's pretty much it, thanks for dropping by!

###### *I never got the chance to explore this back then, but there's no time like the present*
